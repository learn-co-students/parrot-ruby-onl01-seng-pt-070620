# Why Contribute?

Curriculum on Learn is publicly and freely available under Learn's
[Educational Content License](https://learn.co/content-license). By
embracing an open-source contribution model, our goal is for the curriculum
on Learn to become, in time, the best educational content the world has
ever seen.

We need help from the community of Learners to maintain and improve the
educational content. Everything from fixing typos, to correcting
out-dated information, to improving exposition, to adding better examples,
to fixing testsâ€”all contributions to making the curriculum more effective are
welcome.
